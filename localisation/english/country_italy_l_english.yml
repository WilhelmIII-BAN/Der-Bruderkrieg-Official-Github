BENITO_MUSSOLINI_DESC:0 "§g§GBenito Mussolini§! was born in Predappio in 1883. He immigrated from Austria to Italy by way of Young Italy, and became an editor of the leftist newspaper, Avanti! However, he was expelled from the PSI for his support of the Europa Krieg, and began organizing bands of nationalistic youth. It was then that he met §CJulius Evola§! and §OFilippo Marinetti§!, who would define his ideological beliefs. Mussolini joined Evola’s §Coccultist traditionalism§! with Marinetti’s §Oatheist futurism§! to produce an ideology glorifying §Gwar§!, §Gstrength§!, and §GItaly§!.\n\nWith the peace a humiliating betrayal of Italy, Mussolini railed against the left, and North Italy exploded into violence during the §RBiennio Rosso§!, which ended when he seized control of Florence. He gave up many of his futurist principles to make the King appoint him prime minister, which would cause a break with §OMarinetti§!. But, unbeknownst to him, his friend §CEvola§! struck up §Wa friendship with the King§!, who agreed with his radical traditionalist ideas. Mussolini, unaware of the defection of his friends, settled into government. The Grand Fascist Council superseded Parliament and the Acerbo Law granted Mussolini full control. Mussolini’s main enemy was the §Rsocialists§!, divided between the Radicals led by §RAntonio Gramsci§! and Moderates led by §RFerrucio Parri§!. Mussolini initiated §GLa Rinascita§!, a program to promote Italian culture and eliminate socialists. Socialist Leader Giacomo Matteoti was assassinated which sparked outrage and riots that nearly provoked his dismissal, but §CEvola§! convinced the King that the Reds were worse than Mussolini. But, §WVictor Emanuel§!, fearing the socialist reaction and looking to undermine Mussolini, forbade him from purging the Moderates. The king forced Mussolini to adopt “non-violence,” and compliance with the MSVN Blueshirts was permitted.\n\nMussolini hoped that these reforms would cement his rule, but they undermined it. He naively believed he had the Victor's support, while the King and §CEvola§! were plotting to make the latter Prime Minister. §RThe fascist economic boom ended§! as the combination of futurism, syndicalism, and corporatism caused economic instability. §RParri’s support only grew,§! despite MSVN control. But by far the greatest threat was in his own party, divided in four. The first were the §OFuturists§!, enraged at Mussolini for compromising. Then §CEvola’s wing§! of the party, feigning loyalty to Mussolini while planning his downfall with the King. The third were §Bconservatives§! who had joined the party to destroy socialism but were disloyal to fascism. The fourth faction were §Gloyal to Il Duce§! and could be counted on. He still had broad popular support, but many plotted his downfall.\n\nIn 1936, Mussolini remains unaware of his situation, overwhelmed by his belief in §GRoman revival§!. §RHis regime grows shakier everyday, with opponents on all sides plotting his demise.§! Will Mussolini prove himself the heir to Augustus, or will the Ides of March come?§!"

 ITA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After we lost the Bruderkrieg to the Austrians and led the First Brother’s Coalition to a stalemate in the Europakrieg, our unification plans lay in shatters, with Veneto and Rome lying out of our hands. This caused radical solutions as many believed the monarchy had failed. The anarcho-nationalists of Young Italy and Socialists clashed with the Squadristi Gabriel d’Annunzio, leading to D'Annunzio's appointment as prime minister by the king, fearing a radical takeover. He has been Prime Minister and de facto dictator of Italy for 16 years. Despite our weak army, the rising Red threat, and the Mafia plaguing the South, D'Annunzio shall reclaim all our lost lands and restore us to glory. Long live Italy!"

During the early 1800s, we began slowly our general Manfredo Fanti signed a creation decree which created the Army of the Two Sicilies. When the Bruderkrieg was around, our new army was barely tested as we signed an early peace treaty with the treacherous Austrians in order for some of our true lands. Over the years we built a strong army based around the principles of War of Attrition and Cavalry.\n\nWe tried again attacking the Austrians in the Europa Krieg, but that paid little due. At the Battle of Padua , our army was outmaneuvered and crushed by the far superior Austrian generals, whose tactics and technology easily pushed us back. Despite us making gains, it was minor compared to the Russian and Prussian efforts, and our front completely collapsed when the Russians pulled out. In the end, we lost hundreds of thousands of men for small swaths of land. Our army is weak and useless compared to our allies and enemies, and must be examined."

This can never end bloodless.\n\nThe right is barely unified, with the thought of order being the only uniting figure. Men like Evola and his cabinet want a state of madness.

The right overall needs its wits to make this situation work in their favor.\n\nThe left is a much stronger front. The two parties working towards this being powerhouses politically and holding the ire of the population and the world. The left is split between two sides, the Maximalists, and the L'ordine Nuovo.

ITA_evola_tree.1.d:0 "Savoia, King of Italy, third of his name, the matter of the Quadrumvirate returns. The deposed republican traitor Mussolini set up a system in which four men within the Gran Consiglio de Fascismo were given extraordinary powers: De Bono, Grandi, Evola, and Marinetti. De Bono was loyal to Mussolini, Grandi represented the bourgeois conservatives, Marinetti the mad extremists, and Evola the true spirit of Italy. With the ascendance of Evola, it seems that his spot requires a replacement. The choice lies between the army and the MSVN.\n\nGeneral Pietro Badoglio has served with distinction in the army since the Europakrieg and believes in loyalty to the government, as long as it is not communist and maintains the monarchy. He will certainly be a loyal member of government, and has support from our royalist allies in the army. Appointing Badoglio would ensure a fairly sure vote within the Quadrumvirate, support from the royalists in the army, and an ally should de Bono have to be removed.\n\nThe other option is Alessandro Pavolini, head of the MSVN. Pavolini is famous for his fight against the mafia, his fascist principles, and his ruthlessness. His control over MinCulPop and the MSVN makes him a formidable figure and one respected by all fascists. He would certainly be amenable to being appointed Quadrumvir and would be an olive branch to fascists of all stripes. The King would not be happy, given Pavolini’s republican past, but it would consolidate Evola’s support among the PNF easily. Pavolini would be less reliable than Badoglio, and he might make demands to empower the MSVN which would alienate the royalist army faction.\n\nSo what shall we do? Do we back the army and those loyal to Evola, or back the MSVN and unite the party?"

The revolutionary elements who seek to degrade Italy must be silenced, once and for all.\n\nIt seemed the revolutionary penetration had reached into the PNF itself. The lunatic Marinetti and the allies of the traitor Mussolini seek to undermine us at every turn. We must show the subfascists the power of the King and his chief lieutenant. By empowering the crown and convincing Victor Emannuel to show his power to the unbelievers, we shall assert our regal supremacy over the enemies of the kingdom.\n\nOrders from the King have gone out placing all aspects of the state under his control or that of his chief advisor. Lower-ranking political enemies have been arrested and purged. Soon the higher-ups who oppose Evola’s vision of the PNF will go the same way. Nothing will stop us! Avanti!"

Hope and enthusiasm blossomed in Southern Italy, which the King promised to restore and glorify. 75 years later, and that hope is gone.\n\nIt started with the Third War of Italian Independence. Italians across the peninsula rallied to break the hated Austrians and to free Venice. With the cry of, “Primo Venezia Poi Roma!” (First Venice then Rome), the Southerners eagerly rallied to the House of Savoy. As a French general witnessing the Europa Krieg would say later, “All the courage in the world cannot prevail against gunfire,” and so it was with our men. Hundreds of thousands of Italians fought and died for Venice, and instead the King sacrificed Lombardy for peace. The Southern spirit was dented, but not broken. Next the new King, Victor Emmanuel III, promised vengeance. Italy would be free! This time, with all Europe by our side, we would prevail against Austrian tyranny! The South watched in horror as the Northern fields first went fallow and then burned, as the flower of their manhood fell at Padua thanks to the incompetence of Cadorna and the officers, and in fear as the King called to us. Still we answered the call, with the Levy of ‘99, and watched as again, the King sacrificed hundreds of thousands of boys, for they were just 18, for naught. At the peace, Italy was denied even Lombardy, as were our only faithful allies, the Prussians, both of us betrayed by the great menacing bear of the East. But our wrath was reserved not for Russia, but the King. Fool us once, shame on him. Fool us twice, shame on us. The dreams of Garibaldi were dead. The economy, already in bad shape compared to the North, lay in tatters.\n\nIn this state, it was not surprising that veterans turned to crime. Huge crime networks soon lorded over Sicily, and the cynical South accepted it. The Cosa Nostra even enjoyed popular support because they were the one organization that offered security and peace. Finally the South could rest, and was it really not worth the money?\n\nThe South’s economy is a broken relic of the past. Its politics are defined by cynicism and the mafia. But perhaps the fire still burns. Perhaps the South will still fight for Italy. Perhaps the South’s problems would be fixed. But then again, it would take a great leader indeed to do that..."

He believes in securing worker's rights, denouncing Marxism, and reclaiming greater Italy.\n\nConstanzo Ciano, a rival of Bianchi, values a more pragmatic solution to Italy's political and economic problems: allying the corporations, negotiating with the Catholic Church and continuing strong relations with Prussia.\n\nAtillio Teruzzi, the leader of the Blueshirts, has also been gaining more prominence in the party as his militamen help shut down resistance to the ANI. He believes in the total militarization of Italy's industry and mass expansion of the National army to counter any threat that might come Italia's way.\n\nFinally, the wild card: Julius Evola, the leader of the Royalists. His pagan ideas and occultist fantasies have isolated him from much of the party, yet his charisma and ambition has made him a true contender.
